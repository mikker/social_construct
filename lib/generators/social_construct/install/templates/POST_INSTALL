  Next steps:
  
  1. Update the logo path in app/social_cards/application_social_card.rb
     to point to your actual logo file.
  
  2. Run your Rails server and visit:
     http://localhost:3000/rails/social_cards
     
     You should see the example social card previews.
  
  3. Create your own social card classes:
     - Inherit from ApplicationSocialCard
     - Create matching templates in app/views/social_cards/
     - Add preview classes in app/social_cards/previews/
  
  4. Use in your controllers:
     
     class YourController < ApplicationController
       include SocialConstruct::Controller
       
       def og
         @model = Model.find(params[:id])
         render YourSocialCard.new(@model)
       end
     end
